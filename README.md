**Company’s back ground**

AltiQ hardware is a company which has grown vastly in the recent years, and opened business all over the globe. It is a company which sells, computer and computer accessories through three mediums/channel

Retailers
Direct
Distributors

Recently the company has faced a unforeseen loss by opening store in America based on the surveys, intuition and some excel analysis and also the company’s competitors has handful of analytics team to perform analysis and make data driven decision. So, the AltiQ hardware has no other option other than building their analytics team for data driven insights and decisions in the future to survive better in the industry.

**Importing data into PowerBI**

As the database is MySQL in this project, we need to import the datasets from Mysql database to PowerBI by providing the Database access credential.

**Data Model**

1. Data modeling plays a vital role and is considered as the basement of report. All the visuals will be build upon the data model.
2. Poor data modeling affects the over all performance of the report.
3. In this project, we have followed Snowfall data modeling method.
